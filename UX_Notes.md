Apple's approach to design. An extract from one of the interviews - 

> "It's actually the engineering culture, and the way the organization is structured to appreciate and support design. Everybody there is thinking about UX and design, not just the designers. And that's what makes everything about the product so much better . . . much more than any individual designer or design team."



### UI != UX

#### In simple words, visual design is UI or User Interface whereas overall system design is UX.



```
Think and Apply

Try to answer following question honestly and take your time.

- Which one is your favorite app?
- What it does?
- Why do you like it? (Focus on Visual vs Non-visual )
```
